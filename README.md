Summary
-------
In the project we first created a HTTP client in Python and then
we created a HTTP server that can list directories, files and it
can also handle CGI scripts. After extensive debugging, our project
works compeltely, both with single calls and multiple forked calls.

Conclusion
----------
What did we learn?

1. Comp sci majors don't get reading days off
2. By building all the individual functions we got a really good
understanding of how HTTP client + servers interact and we all have
a much deeper and applicable understanding of the concepts we covered
in class.


Contributions
-------------

Started off with Rae on Thor and then a lot of the functions.
Rad + Rae then worked on few more functions. 
Then Shane and Rad finishing + lots of debugging
